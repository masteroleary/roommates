`The purpose of this document is to ensure that no one feels like they are doing more than the others living together and that everyone is held accountable to contribute equally. This list will be printed out on a clipboard for each Matthew O'leary to initial every 7 days or so.

### Mutual Roommate Agreement
- Bedtime is at 12AM. If anyone is in their rooms upstairs, keep the noise quiet out of respect
- If you are going to have people over make sure they do the same, unless its loud sex, then its ok.
- When creating dishes during the day wash them after. If you create them late at night and leave them in the sink
take care of them before 9AM and before you leave the house
- If you need a dish from the dishwasher try to empty it.
- If you unlock the dishwasher and do not empty it, lock it again to signal that the dishes are clean.
- If you cook something messy on the stove wipe it down after
- If you use the counter to prepare food, wipe down the crumps and spills
- Clean up after yourself, empty the bathroom trash, do the little things if it needs to be done even if its not your week for that chore list.
- These chores are to improve upon an already clean house. If you make a mess it is your responsibility to clean it, regardless of the rotation.
- A pool of $80 will be established for purchasing supplies and placed in the bathroom. When there is less than $20 each member will contribute $10 to the fund, and the accounting is to be written on the envalope.
- Chore completion should be verified by another party in a timely manner.
- The person who purchases supplies will leave the reciept in the supplies pool envalope for review
- Cleaning supplies needed to complete chores should be itemized on the following week's chore list, added when they run out by the person using them

# Chore Rotation Schedule - Date __________
Each list should be rotated once a week from Friday to Sunday. If you would like to complete tasks earlier or later you must have cause (schedule or travel plans that must be approved by roommates). If you require an extension, ask for it before 6PM on the day that it is due. Late completion (while present) incurrs a cost of $10 per day into the supply pool (to be added in cash to the supplies pool on the day that the chore is completed. Don't repeat doing a list until everyone else has done the list again first. Cost of items that need replacements can be split but its your turn to take care of it. If you are absent for the week prior to your scheduled day, your week will be swapped with the next person in the rotation without asking for a deferrment.
