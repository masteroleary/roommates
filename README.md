`This may seem like an exhaustive list. It is the result of one bad egg who did a half assed job cleaning while the other tenants had to wipe up his piss. Literally that happened. The purpose of this document is to ensure that no one feels like they are doing more than the other tenants and that everyone is held accountable to contribute equally. Things can be lax and easy going until someone inconveniences everyone else. Be a decent human.`

### Mutual Roommate Agreement
- Bedtime is at 12AM. Everyone works on a different schedule. If anyone is in their rooms upstairs, keep the noise quiet out of respect
- If you are going to have people over make sure they do the same, unless its loud sex, then it's ok.
- When creating dishes during the day wash them after. If you create them late at night and leave them in the sink
take care of them before 9AM and before you leave the house
- If you need a dish from the dishwasher try to empty it.
- If you unlock the dishwasher and do not empty it, lock it again to signal that the dishes are clean.
- If you cook something messy on the stove wipe it down after
- If you use the counter to prepare food, wipe down the crumps and spills
- Clean up after yourself, empty the bathroom trash, do the little things if it needs to be done even if its not your week for that chore list.
- These chores are to improve upon an already clean house. If you make a mess it is your responsibility to clean it, regardless of the rotation.
- A pool of $80 will be established for purchasing supplies. When there is less than $20 each member will contribute $10 to the fund, and the accounting is to be written on the envelope. 
- The person who purchases supplies will leave the reciept in the supplies pool envelope for review
